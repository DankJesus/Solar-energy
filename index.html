    <p class="title"> Solar Energy </p>
    <p class="point"> <u> What is solar energy? </u>
      <p class="subpoint"> Energy provided by the sun! Solar energy is both renewable and infinite (well, <i> almost </i> infinite) </p>

    </p>
    <p class="point"> <u> Why is solar energy renewable? </u>
      <p class="subpoint"> As the sun is a near-infinite energy, the energy it provides can be used for electricity as long as there <i> is </i> a sun. </p>
    </p>
      <p class="point"> <u> Why aren't we only using solar energy then? </u>
      <p class="subpoint"> To begin, contructing solar panels to absorb the sun's energy costs a lot of money. A lot more than using fossil fuels. <br> It's also a good idea to note that solar energy <i>only</i>  works when there is sun out. <br> Therefore, during the night or in places where there is little sun, very little-to-no solar energy is produced.  </p>
    </p>
      <p class="point"> <u> Why isn't solar energy infinite? </u>
      <p class="subpoint"> You'll be dead by the time the sun dies, but in about 7 billion years we won't have a sun. No sun, no solar energy. The Earth will have been engulfed in flames by then, anyway. </p>
    </p>
    <p class="point"> <u> Do you think that we will ever resort to using solar energy? </u>
      <p class="subpoint"> Yes and no. <br> Fossil fuels are destined to run out soon, but other renewable resources such as hydroelectricity and wind mills can, and will, be used. </p>
